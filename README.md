BundleBoss
==========

BundleBoss does all the dirty Bundler work for you. Watches your projects' Gemfiles for changes and automatically updates your bundle.

It's meant to run with [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) on Mac OS X.

It Just Worksâ„¢.

How?
----

Install BundleBoss:

    $> gem install bundle_boss

Generate your .bundle_boss settings file in your $HOME:

    # BundleBoss settings
    settings:
      # Show Growl notifications.
      notifications: true
      # Run 'bundle update' when required.
      update: true
    
    # Bundler settings. Can be any valid Bundler option.
    bundler:
      # Equivalent to: --binstubs
      binstubs: true
      # Equivalent to: --shebang ruby-local-exec
      shebang: ruby-local-exec
    
    # A list of your Bundler enabled projects.
    projects:
     - ~/src/omg
     - ~/src/wtf

Start BundleBoss:

    $> bundle_boss
